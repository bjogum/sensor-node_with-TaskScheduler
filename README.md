## Alarm sensor node, with custom task scheduler → ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-under%20development-8A2BE2)
#### Overview
This is a modular component of a larger IoT system (Smart Hub) consisting of multiple nodes.

This repo handles all sensor data for an alarm system, utilizing an Arduino Uno R4 WiFi with a bespoke non-blocking task scheduler to manage concurrent sensor polling and network communication. Sensor data is distributed to neighboring nodes via Wi-Fi using the MQTT protocol, and via BLE.
