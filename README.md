## Alarm sensor node, with custom task scheduler → ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-under%20development-8A2BE2)
#### Overview
This is a modular component of a larger IoT system (Smart Hub) consisting of multiple nodes.

This repo handles all sensor data for an alarm system, utilizing an Arduino Uno R4 WiFi with a bespoke non-blocking task scheduler to manage concurrent sensor polling and network communication. Sensor data is distributed to neighboring nodes via Wi-Fi using the MQTT protocol, and via BLE.

#### Architecture - Event-driven Real-Time Scheduler

The system decouples critical detection from application logic for maximum reliability:

* **Hardware Interrupts (PIR/Reed):** Ensures microsecond detection latency, independent of system load.
* **Deterministic Timing (SysTick):** Provides a stable 1ms hardware time-base for precise logging and synchronization.
* **Asynchronous Execution:** The main loop handles status LEDs, indoor temp/humidity, and resource-heavy communication (BLE/WiFi) by acting on flags and timestamps from the hardware layer.

#### Setup - Info

1) Update your WIFI: SSID + Password → plattformio.ini
2) Update your Broker/Zero IP adress → mqtt_client.cpp
3) Startup time ~20s → when system is up and running : red blink on the led matrix
