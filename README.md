## Alarm sensor node, with custom task scheduler → ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-under%20development-8A2BE2)
#### Overview
This is a modular component of a larger IoT system (Smart Hub) consisting of multiple nodes.

This repo handles all sensor data for an alarm system, utilizing an Arduino Uno R4 WiFi with a bespoke non-blocking task scheduler to manage concurrent sensor polling and network communication. Sensor data is distributed to neighboring nodes via Wi-Fi using the MQTT protocol, and via BLE.

#### Architecture
-

#### Development : Info / Setup

###### *To do:*
* Update your WIFI: SSID + Password → plattformio.ini
* Update your Broker/Zero IP adress → mqtt_client.cpp

###### *Good to know:*
* WiFi must be working to start-up right now..
* Startup time ~20s → when system is up and running : red blink on the led matrix

#### Hardware
* MCU: Arduino Uno R4 WiFi

* Sensor:
